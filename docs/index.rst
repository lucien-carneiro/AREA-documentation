Welcome to our AREA documentation!
====================================

**AREA** is the final project made in our third year in Epitech.
The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the creation of a business application.
To do this, we implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.

This software suite will be broken into three parts : </br>
- **An application server** to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
- **A web client** to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
- **A mobile client** to use the application from your phone by querying the application server
